              An island is a body of land surrounded by water. Continents are also surrounded by water, but because they
              are so big, they are not considered islands. Australia, the smallest continent, is more than three times
              the size of Greenland, the largest island. There are countless islands in the ocean, lakes, and rivers
              around the world. They vary greatly in size, climate, and the kinds of organisms that inhabit them.
